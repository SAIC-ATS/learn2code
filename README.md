## General Tips

1. **Learn terminology** - learning terminology helps you understand what is possible, what to search for, and how better to prompt an AI coding assistant.

1. **Beware the XY Problem** - The [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/) is a way of thinking about how to ask for help solving problems, and is useful in all domains—not just coding. Essentially, it's a way to help you ask better questions by getting you to ask about the *problem itself* instead of what you *think* the solution is. 

1. **Gain comfort connecting different languages and contexts** – Any intermediate to advanced project you approach will require multiple tools working together. You often can't *just* use p5.js, or *just* Python. Cobbling together multiple tools for the job is often how problems must be solved, rather than forcing one tool to do everything.

1. **Exposure over mastery** – Don't worry about "getting good" at languages. Be open to working across multiple contexts.
