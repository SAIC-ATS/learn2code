# learn2code - Code and software tools and learning resources for AT/SP

This is a non-comprehensive list of resources for venturing into creative code and software tools that brush up against creative code. The resources shared here have (mostly) been vetted or tested before adding. This is not a gaurantee that they'll work on your machine ðŸ˜‰.

This is a living document. Resources will go out of date; new resources will be added. For now, most of these resources are related to the learn2code workshop held on June 15, 2025. More resources will be added.

# Learning

## Shortcut: What tools should I use?

- [**HTML**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) + [**CSS**](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) + [**JavaScript**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp): for web-based projects. [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) for working with web servers.

- [**p5.js**](https://p5js.org/): for creative coding on the web. Can be used for interactive installations, but is best used on the web.

- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): a text editor for building your coding projects. Use this to work on your web code (HTML + CSS + JS), Python, or other types of coding projects.

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): for all sorts of things. Good for simple scripts for processing data, images, video, etc. Heavily used in AI/machine learning, and is the scripting language for tools like TouchDesigner and Blender. Mac computers come with Python pre-installed, but different projects will require different versions. You'll want to familiarize yourself with [**Python Environments**](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) before working with Python.

- [**TouchDesigner**](https://derivative.ca/download) for generative/interactive installations and realtime performances.

- [**Arduino**](https://docs.arduino.cc/programming/) (the programming language) for programming microcontrollers.

- [**Max**](https://cycling74.com/products/max) for interactive installations and realtime performances that are geared towards sound synthesis.

- [**git**](https://git-scm.com/) + [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) for managing your coding projects, using open source code repositories in your projects, and hosting free static websites. Use the [**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/download/) app for beginner-friendly GitHub repository management.

- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) + [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for note-taking.

- [**Unity**](https://unity.com/) + [**C#**](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php) for working with game engines ([**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) and [**C++**](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp) are also available, but classes in our department focus on Unity and C#)
