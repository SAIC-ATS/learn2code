# learn2code - Code and software tools for AT/SP

This is a non-comprehensive list of resources for venturing into creative code and software tools that brush up against creative code. The resources shared here have (mostly) been vetted or tested before adding. This is not a gaurantee that they'll work on your machine ðŸ˜‰

This is a living document. Resources will go out of date; new resources will be added.

## Libraries, plugins and tools

## General Tips

1. **Learn terminology** - learning terminology helps you understand what is possible, what to search for, and how better to prompt an AI coding assistant.

1. **Beware the XY Problem** - The [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/) is a way of thinking about how to ask for help solving problems, and is useful in all domainsâ€”not just coding. Essentially, it's a way to help you ask better questions by getting you to ask about the *problem itself* instead of what you *think* the solution is. 

1. **Gain comfort connecting different languages and contexts** â€“ Any intermediate to advanced project you approach will require multiple tools working together. You often can't *just* use p5.js, or *just* Python. Cobbling together multiple tools for the job is often how problems must be solved, rather than forcing one tool to do everything.

1. **Exposure over mastery** â€“ Don't worry about "getting good" at languages. Be open to working across multiple contexts.
